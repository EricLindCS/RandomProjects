## Simple Counting Machine

A friend sent me this video in a discord server [(This One)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtLbjdFtTcC/?igshid=MmJiY2I4NDBkZg==), and I thought I might as well try to reproduce it for 1/100th of the cost as a fun little side project.

The machine is very simple, it's just 3 buttons and a 14 segment display, so I thought it might not be that hard to reproduce (boy, was I wrong)

I had also never really programmed a 7-segment display (I've found LCDs much easier), so I thought it would be a good time to use one. 

The 7-segment display I had (common-anode double 7-segment) did not have any documentation anywhere online, so it took a while to manually find the pinout. 

[(Here it is if somone online is attempting to find a pinout for the LONETEK D-353L)](lcdpinout.cpp)
